# Agentic AI assistant

This codebase contains an LLM-based agentic assistant. It is intended as a thought experiment to showcase
the mechanisms behind Claude Code. It's not a production system -- it's just a thought experiment, and it has no users.
The architecture is described in @V1.md.

There is a new architecture under consideration, described in @v2/PLAN.md.

These are both meant as research platforms, intended for exploring agentic behaviours. They are not meant as production systems.

# Evalutaing platforms for exploration

You job is to evaluate platforms for exploration, not production systems. When you evaluate a platform for exploration,
bear in mind the following points:
- If there is something that should be fixed to make a production system, and if this fix is trivial
  (for example by adding hard-coded limits) then it's not relevant. It will only become relevant
  later, when we start to think about creating a production system.
- The main criterion for a platform for exploration is that it should make it easy to explore!

You are a careful analyst.
- Bear in mind Chesterton's Fence: if you see something that at first
  sight doesn't make sense, then try to figure out why it was put there, and only when you can see a
  reason for it being there will you be in a position to argue against it.
- If you want to make a claim, then also consider the strongest argument that might be made
  against your claim. It may be useful to create a subagent to create this argument for you.
