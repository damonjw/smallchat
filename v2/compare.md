The current architecture of this codebase is summarized in @V1.md. I'm planning a new architecture,
described in @v2/PLAN.md. Review this plan. Are there any issues? For each issue you identify, 
start a subagent and ask the subagent to consider carefully whether it is a genuine issue. 

In your analysis of v2, if you spot an issue, look in the plan to see if it has any comments
about that issue. Evaluate such comments -- you might not agree with them! But your job is to
provide a fair evaluation, not to argue against the plan purely for the sake of argument.
