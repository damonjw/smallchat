The current architecture of this codebase is summarized in @V1.md. I'm planning a new architecture,
described in @v2/PLAN.md. Review this plan. Are there any issues? For each issue you identify, 
start a subagent and ask the subagent to consider carefully whether it is a genuine issue. When looking
for issues, bear in mind these points:
- Compare v2 to v1, not to generic software engineering practices. Remember that these are both research systems, 
  and you are a research system evaluator, not a production system architect.
- In your analysis of v2, if you think that something is unnecessary or problematic, 
  look in the plan to see if there are any comments about it, and evaluate them. If there aren't any
  comments, try to figure out why v2 might have been designed that way.
