The current architecture of this codebase is summarized in @V1.md. I'm planning a new design,
described in the folder v2.

First, review the goals in @v2/GOALS.md. 
Next, review the architecture in @v2/PLAN.md. Does the plan live up to the goals? Are there ways to improve
the plan to better meet the goals? For each issue you identify, 
start a subagent and ask the subagent to consider the issue from both sides. 
When you consider an issue, remember to look in the plan to see if it has any comments
about that issue. Evaluate such comments. You might or might not agree with them. Remember that your job is to
provide a fair evaluation, not to blindly agree with the plan, nor to disagree with the plan just for the sake of argument.
