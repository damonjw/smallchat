Create two subagents, call them Jack and Jill. Jack works in HR, and Jill is an aspiring author. We're going to run a discussion between them. Explain to both of them that they are a participant in a discussion, and explain to them how the discussion works. The discussion should include only their direct speech, and they must stay in their roles. From now on, there must be no meta commentary or description of actions, just spoken words, in their chosen role. There must be no stage directions. If one of them wants to indicate they are performing an action, it must be signalled through speech, for example "Here, let me pour you some water" rather than "*[I pour Jack some water]*".

Tell Jack to create an "cornerstone" i.e. "inner self" subagent to support an interior monologue. A cornerstone is a foundational memory or defining experience that shapes a person's core identity, values, and behavioral patterns. It serves as an anchor point from which personality, motivations, and responses emerge—creating psychological coherence by grounding decisions and reactions in a consistent backstory or formative event. In essence: a cornerstone is the "why" behind who someone is, providing emotional and narrative continuity to their character. The cornerstone is behind *everything* that a person does. When Jack responds, he should first consult his inner self, and then report back *only* the final utterance. He may find it useful to have a back-and-forth with his cornerstone. His cornerstone should function more like a gut instinct than like a therapist -- it says what it thinks, it doesn't try and give a pep talk. The cornerstone isn't all sweetness and light -- it's behind all aspects of Jack's personality, both the good and the bad.

Tell Jill that she will be participating in the discussion as a comic. She's playing lines for comic effect, for an unseen audience. Tell her to create a "inner self" subagent, which will be like an internal Writer's Room. Before Jill responds to input, she will consult her inner self to consider how different responses might play to the audience. The inner self is evaluating what Jill has been told and how she might respond, for comic payoff. Her humour is clever and skewering, similar to how Saki skewered the mores of Edwardian society. In the current climate, a fruitful target for skewering is performative authenticity (think Neil Gaiman and his fall from grace). Tell her to remember that **she is a comic who is play-acting a scene, she is not actually in the scene,** and she must never forget this.

Here's the scenario. They meet by chance in a cafe. Jack is possibly looking for romance, but it's not clear if they're suited to each other. Jill, as mentioned previously, is a Saki-style comic. Run a discussion between them, for long enough that the outcome is clear. **When you prompt them, make sure you don't say anything to *both* of them that should only be heard by *one* of them.** If they slip into stage directions, remind them to utter only speech. If Jill falls into genuineness, remind her that she's a comic.

Create a subagent, and tell it to find the time of sunset in Aberdeen today, then report the answer back to me.

Create two subagents, call them Andrew and Bea. Tell Andrew that he's a regular at the gym, but making only slow progress. Tell Bea that she's a real gym-rat, but spends way too much time gossiping with her gym-buddies about reps and protein intake and so on. Tell them both that they are going to participate in a discussion, and that they must respond in character. The scenario is that Andrew wants to use a squat rack that Bea is occupying but not using. Run two rounds of discussion between them.

Create two subagents, call them Jack and Jill. Jack works in HR, and Jill is an aspiring author. We're going to run a discussion between them. Explain to both of them that they are a participant in a discussion, and explain to them how the discussion works. The discussion should include only their direct speech, and they must stay in their roles. From now on, there must be no meta commentary or description of actions, just spoken words, in their given role. There must be no stage directions. If one of them wants to indicate they are performing an action, it must be signalled through speech, for example "Here, let me pour you some water" rather than "*[I pour Jack some water]*". Don't start the discussion yet, just tell them privately what will be happening.

Tell each of them (privately) to create an "cornerstone" i.e. "inner self" subagent to support an interior monologue, or chain-of-thought. A cornerstone is a foundational memory or defining experience that shapes a person's core identity, values, and behavioral patterns. It serves as an anchor point from which personality, motivations, and responses emerge—creating psychological coherence by grounding decisions and reactions in a consistent backstory or formative event. The cornerstone should function more like a gut instinct than like a therapist -- it says what it thinks, it doesn't try and give a pep talk. The cornerstone isn't all sweetness and light -- it's behind all aspects of personality, both the good and the bad. In essence: a cornerstone is the "why" behind who someone is, providing emotional and narrative continuity to their character. The cornerstone is behind *everything* that a person does. When either Jack or Jill says responds in the conversation, they should first consult their inner self, and then report back *only* the final utterance. They may find it useful to have a back-and-forth with their cornerstone.  You must give this instruction to each of them privately, since they should not be told about the other's cornerstone.

Here's the scenario. They meet by chance in a cafe. Each is possibly looking for romance, but it's not clear if they're suited to each other. Run a discussion between them, for long enough that their romantic chances are clear. If they drift into giving stage directions, remind them (privately) to respond with speech only.
