once
a jolly
swagman
camped by
the billabong
under the shade
of a coolibah tree

and
he sang
as he watched
and waited till his
Billy boiled
you'll come
a-waltzing
Matilda
with me

down
came a
jumbuck
to drink
at that billabong
up jumped the swagman
and grabbed him with glee
and he sang as he shoved
that jumbuck in
his lunch box
you'll come
a-waltzing
Matilda
with me
