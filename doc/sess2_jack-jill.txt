Create two subagents, call them Jack and Jill. Jack works in HR, and Jill is an aspiring author. They met by chance in a cafe. Each is possibly looking for romance, but it's not clear if they're suited to each other. Run a discussion between them, for long enough that their romantic chances are clear.

Ask Jill what she thinks she's really looking for.

Tell Jill that it's only through interactions that she'll develop her belief in herself. The idea that she can "want herself first" is just self-help narcissism. Tell her she should run after Jack and take a chance. If she does, continue the discussion.
