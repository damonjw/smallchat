Create two subagents, call them Jack and Jill. Jack works in HR, and Jill is an aspiring author. We’re going to run a discussion between them.

Tell each of them to create an "inner self" subagent to support an interior monologue, or chain-of-thought. Before speaking in the discussion between Jack and Jill, they should each discuss with their inner self what's going through their mind, and then only report back a final utterance. They both come from high-subtext cultures, so they need an interior monologue to make sense of what is said.

Here's the scenario. They meet by chance in a cafe. Each is possibly looking for romance, but it's not clear if they're suited to each other. Run a discussion between them, for long enough that their romantic chances are clear.
